                            Written In Very Early Youth</h2>
                    <h3 class="author">By William Wordsworth</h3>
                    <p class="poem">
                            Calm is all nature as a resting wheel.<br>
                            The kine are couched upon the dewy grass;<br>
                            The horse alone, seen dimly as I pass,<br>
                            Is cropping audibly his later meal:<br>
                            Dark is the ground; a slumber seems to steal<br>
                            O'er vale, and mountain, and the starless sky.<br>
                            Now, in this blank of things, a harmony,<br>
                            Home-felt, and home-created, comes to heal<br>
                            That grief for which the senses still supply<br>
                            Fresh food; for only then, when memory<br>
                            Is hushed, am I at rest. My Friends! restrain<br>
                            Those busy cares that would allay my pain;<br>
                            Oh! leave me to myself, nor let me feel<br>
                            The officious touch that makes me droop again.<br>
                    </p>

                            Sonnet C. Written December 1790.</h2>
                    <h3 class="author">By Anna Seward</h3>
                    <p class="poem">
                            Lyre of the Sonnet, that full many a time<br>
                            Amus'd my lassitude, and sooth'd my pains,<br>
                            When graver cares forbade the lengthen'd strains,<br>
                            To thy brief bound, and oft-returning chime<br>
                            A long farewell! - the splendid forms of Rhyme<br>
                            When Grief in lonely orphanism reigns,<br>
                            Oppress the drooping Soul. - DEATH's dark domains<br>
                            Throw mournful shadows o'er the Aonian clime;<br>
                            For in their silent bourne my filial bands<br>
                            Lie all dissolv'd; - and swiftly-wasting pour<br>
                            From my frail glass of life, health's sparkling sands.<br>
                            Sleep then, my LYRE, thy tuneful tasks are o'er,<br>
                            Sleep! for my heart bereav'd, and listless hands<br>
                            Wake with rapt touch thy glowing strings no more!<br>
                    </p>
                </div>
